Using `useEffect` for redirection and the `redirect` function from `next/navigation` serve similar purposes but differ in **when** and **how** the redirection happens. Here's a comparison to help you decide:

---

### 1. **Using `useEffect` for Redirection**

If you redirect in the `useEffect` hook, it happens **client-side** after the component has been mounted.

```tsx
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

export default function MainPage() {
    const router = useRouter();

    useEffect(() => {
        router.push("/main/home"); // Redirect client-side
    }, [router]);

    return null; // Component renders nothing
}
```

- **How It Works**:

    - The page initially renders.
    - After rendering, the `useEffect` runs and triggers the redirection.

- **Downsides**:
    - There may be a **brief flicker** as the page first renders before redirecting.
    - Less efficient because the unnecessary rendering happens before redirection.

---

### 2. **Using `redirect` (Server-Side)**

The `redirect` function is executed during the server-side rendering phase (or when generating static content).

```tsx
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

export default function MainPage() {
    redirect("/main/home"); // Redirect server-side
}
```

- **How It Works**:

    - Redirection happens **before** the page renders on the client.
    - The user is sent directly to the `/main/home` page without rendering `/main`.

- **Benefits**:
    - **More efficient**: No unnecessary rendering of the `/main` page.
    - **No flicker**: The browser is sent directly to the target URL.
    - Preferred for performance and UX, especially when using server-side rendering in Next.js.

### **Key Differences**:

| **Aspect**           | **`useEffect`**                                                             | **`redirect`**                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **When It Happens**  | After the page is rendered                                                  | Before the page is rendered             |
| **Where It Happens** | Client-side                                                                 | Server-side                             |
| **Performance**      | Slower, unnecessary rendering first                                         | Faster, skips rendering `/main`         |
| **User Experience**  | May cause flickering                                                        | Seamless transition                     |
| **Use Case**         | Use only if redirection depends on client-side logic (e.g., state or props) | Use for static or predictable redirects |

---

### **Which One Is Better?**

- **Use `redirect`** (from `next/navigation`) when the redirection is static and predictable (e.g., `/main` always redirects to `/main/home`). It is more efficient and provides a better user experience.
- **Use `useEffect`** only if the redirection logic depends on **client-side data** (e.g., after fetching data or checking session state).

In your case, since `/main` should always redirect to `/main/home`, **`redirect` is the better choice.**
